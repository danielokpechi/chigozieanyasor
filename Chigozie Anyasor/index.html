								During my tenure at MTN Nigeria, I accomplished significant achievements. Firstly, I
								successfully improved the web workflow processes, streamlining operations and enhancing
								overall efficiency. Additionally, I played a key role in converting the website into a
								cross-browser compatible platform, ensuring a seamless user experience across different
								browsers.

								I also made substantial contributions to the optimization and fine-tuning of the
								MTNonline database, enhancing its performance and functionality. One notable achievement
								was the development of a Sim-Swap page, which provided a convenient solution for
								customers who had lost or damaged their SIM cards. This feature was seamlessly
								integrated into the MTN Customer Care system and facilitated the extraction of data from
								the sim-swap database.

								Furthermore, I designed and implemented a customer information collection page, which
								proved to be invaluable for MTN Customer Care. This page streamlined the process of
								gathering essential customer data and significantly improved efficiency. Additionally, I
								developed a corporate help desk request page that offered comprehensive support to
								corporate clients through the MTN Customer Care platform.

								Throughout my role, I took on various responsibilities, including assuming the position
								of Quality Assurance Manager, where I ensured compliance with MTN Nigeria guidelines and
								international standards. I also undertook the online real-time management of the MTN
								Nigeria website, overseeing its day-to-day operations and ensuring its smooth
								functioning.

								Moreover, I actively contributed to the development of web applications supporting
								different units within the MTN head office. Through ongoing research and development
								efforts, I stayed updated with cutting-edge web technologies that offered
								result-oriented functionalities for various projects.

								Some of the notable projects I handled included the creation of the welcome back request
								page, the MTN customer details update feature, and the development of the corporate
								support help desk web module.

								Overall, my contributions and achievements during my tenure at MTN Nigeria significantly
								impacted the company's web presence, streamlined internal processes, and enhanced
								customer care services.
